# Apri Pandu Wicaksono

Hi, 👋I’m Apri, a student from [Smk Telkom Purwokerto](https://github.com/smktelkompwt), also a software developer with 6 months intership experience who believes in changing the world. Usually use php, javascript, and css programming languages, for website programming I use the laravel framework, bootstrap, and vue javascript. I have a high curiosity to learn the features of a system 🚀
